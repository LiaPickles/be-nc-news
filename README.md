Now you have cloned the project, you will need to create two .env files: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the coorect database name for that environment. To see the correct database names, head to the setup.sql file within the db (database) directory. Make sure to double check that these .env files are .gitignored to ensure they are not pushed up into github.
